## Brief Explanation of Each Task

**Task 1**
: The function processArray takes in an array of numbers then returns the square of a number if the number appears to be an even number else would return three times of the number or the number tripled. This is achieved by using the tenary operator ?: in javascript. The condition to check if it is an even number is a modulos function, if true then the operand after the question mark executes, else if otherwise, then the code after the colon executes. The .map simply runs through or iterates all numbers of the array.


**Task 2**
: The function formatArrayStrings takes in an array of strings and arrays of numbers processed from the processArray function. arrNumbers in the code are the processed numbers from the processArray function. It could be declared if the the processArray function had a set of numbers working on. The formatArrayStrings returns an array of strings where the .map picks picks a string compare with one number in the other array, then if number is even, the entire string is capitalize or otherwise converts string to lowercase.



**Task 3**
: This has a function createUserProfiles having two parameters names and Modified names. It returns an array of objects containing an original name together with its modified name. The use of .map helps to iterate through the set of modified names and then add the required name to it. And the user id auto-incremented using i + 1 which increases as the array of objects proceeds.


**Task 4**
: This is the README.md file and the markdown language is adopted.
